Project Description
===================

This is still a preliminary phase for Mini Pig data processing.

The initial goal is to identify how TRACK-HD like image processing tools and methodologies can be
ported to work on the MiniPigs.

An Atlas needs to be generated and anatomical structures identified in the mini-pigs.

Iowa team will help/consult Geroge-Huntington-Institute team to process their longitudinal MRI data set from Mini Pig.

About 32 Mini Pig data sets collected on a Phillips Scanner
2~3 Scans per pig (Annually/Biannually)

Project Justification
======================

HD Minipig data processing has been discussed in EHDN conference. We may find a proper grant as well for collaboration.

Translating mini pig findings to human findings, or vise versa.

Disease modifying changes
